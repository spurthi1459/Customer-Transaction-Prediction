# Customer-Transaction-Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to make a transaction
using machine learning classification techniques. It demonstrates an end-to-end
data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA),
model training, and evaluation.

## Problem Statement
Businesses need to understand and predict customer behavior to improve decision-making.
This project aims to identify customers who are likely to perform transactions based on
historical and behavioral data.

## Business Use Case
Predicting customer transactions helps organizations:
- Target potential customers more effectively
- Optimize marketing strategies
- Improve customer engagement and retention
- Allocate business resources efficiently

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was provided for academic purposes.
Due to data access and usage constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Approach
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature handling and preparation
5. Model training using classification algorithms
6. Model evaluation using performance metrics
7. Interpretation of results

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Classification-based Machine Learning Model (primary model)

## Results
The trained model demonstrates reasonable performance in predicting customer
transaction behavior, showing the feasibility of using machine learning
for customer behavior analysis.

## Limitations
- Dataset size may limit generalization
- Feature set is predefined and limited
- Performance may vary on real-world customer data
